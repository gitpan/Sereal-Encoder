  - "undef_unknown" option will cause unsupported Perl types to be
    encoded as "undef" instead of throwing an exception.
  - Similarly, "stringify_unknown" will make those unsupported types
    be stringified instead. The two options are mutually exclusive.
  - "warn_unknown" option (only meaningful if "stringify_unknown" or
    "undef_unknown" are active) will cause a warning to be issued when
    an unsupported type is encoded as a string or as undef.
  - Bug fixes for encoding the contents of tied hashes (the tiedness
    itself is not preserved by design).
  - Solaris build fix.
  - Test fixes for threaded perls (likely working around a bug in Perl
  - Improved documentation.
